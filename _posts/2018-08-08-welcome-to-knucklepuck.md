Our goal is to make statistical hockey analysis easier to follow, interpret, and interact with by showing our readers the mechanics of how the analysis is produced. We don't hide our data or our code - we keep it transparent and encourage our readers to use our tools themselves.  

Our articles might reference data that we have created ourselves. Although there are great sources of data available elsewhere, we found the available sources can either be unusable with common software (such as Excel) or not comprehensive enough for advanced analysis. 

Our data set is user-friendly, customizable, and accessible. We've published a group of files and scripts on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/harrisonsjones/fantasy-hockey
