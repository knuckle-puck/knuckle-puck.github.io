KnucklePuck was created with the purpose of bringing hockey analytics to a wider audience. We believe that the average hockey fan, regardless of their mathematical expertise, has a lot to gain from the type of analysis on this website.

As a secondary goal we wanted to remain open and transparent regarding the analysis we are performing. All data and code is available to the public for those that are interesting in diving into the technical side of our work. We like to share ideas, in all mediums, and believe healthy collaboration can help us grow.

Will and Harrison are both avid fans of playing and watching hockey. They both also participate (with varying levels of success) in a fantasy hockey league.
