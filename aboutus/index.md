## About Us 

KnucklePuck was created with the purpose of bringing hockey analytics to a wider audience. We also want to remain open and transparent with our analysis. All of our data and code is available to the public for those that are interesting in diving into the technical side of our work. We like to share ideas, in all mediums, and believe healthy collaboration can help us grow.

Harrison and Will are avid fans of playing and watching hockey. They both also participate (with varying levels of success) in a fantasy hockey league.
